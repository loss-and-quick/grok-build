//! Sidecar supervisor for grok-build TypeScript plugins.
//!
//! A [`PluginHost`] owns one sidecar process per registered TS plugin, speaks the
//! versioned wire contract (`xai-grok-plugin-protocol`) with each over
//! newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0, and implements
//! [`xai_grok_hooks::invoker::PluginHookInvoker`] so the hook runner can drive a
//! `Plugin` handler without knowing anything about processes or the wire.
//!
//! # Module map
//!
//! - [`runtime`] — runtime discovery (bun → node >=22 → deno) and argv construction.
//! - [`sidecar`] — one child + its bidirectional JSON-RPC loop.
//! - [`capabilities`] — the plugin→core server (`log_emit`, `storage_*`, `config_get`).
//! - [`supervisor`] — [`PluginHost`]: restart-on-crash, disable-after-N, routing.
//!
//! # Lifecycle: lazy start
//!
//! Sidecars start **lazily**, on a plugin's first invocation, not at
//! registration. Session startup stays cheap: a plugin that never fires an event
//! it subscribed to never costs a process. The one-time price is that the first
//! matching event pays the spawn+handshake latency and cannot short-circuit on
//! subscriptions (they're only known post-handshake). [`PluginHost::start_all`]
//! is offered for callers that prefer eager warm-up.
//!
//! # Sandboxing
//!
//! Plugins inherit the parent's Landlock/Seatbelt confinement automatically (they
//! are children of the sandboxed process). The per-child seccomp network filter
//! for `network: false` plugins is *not* wired here — see the `TODO` in
//! [`runtime::build_command`]; that `unsafe pre_exec` belongs to the
//! shell-integration task which owns `xai-grok-sandbox`.
